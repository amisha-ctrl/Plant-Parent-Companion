                <p class="plant-para">Watering: <br><br>
                    Most foliage plants prefer to be kept evenly moist but not soggy. Water when the top 1-2 inches of soil feels dry. Reduce watering during the dormant period (usually winter or cooler months) to avoid overwatering.
                    <br><br>
                    Light: <br> <br>
                    Most foliage plants thrive in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight as it can scorch the leaves. Low-light foliage plants are also available for darker indoor spaces.
                    <br> <br>
                    Temperature: <br> <br>
                    Most foliage plants prefer temperatures between 65¬∞F to 75¬∞F (18¬∞C to 24¬∞C). Avoid sudden temperature changes and drafts.
                    <br> <br>
                    Humidity: <br> <br>
                    Many foliage plants enjoy higher humidity levels, especially if they are tropical or subtropical varieties. Regular misting or placing them near a humidifier can help maintain humidity.
